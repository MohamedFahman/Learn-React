        I'm Fahman. I am an ambitious 3rd-year computer engineering student with
        a strong interest in mobile application development and databases.
        Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired a solid foundation in
        computer science concepts, programming languages, and software
        development methodologies. I possess a creative mindset, constantly
        seeking innovative solutions to complex problems. I stay up-to-date with
        the latest trends in mobile app development and have hands-on experience
        with languages like Java, Python, and C++, as well as frameworks such as
        Android Studio and React Native. Additionally, I have a strong
        understanding of database management systems, including SQL and NoSQL,
        and have successfully implemented database-driven applications. In my
        free time, I work on personal projects to enhance my skills and showcase
        my creativity.
